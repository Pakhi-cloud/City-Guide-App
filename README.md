Our project aims to provide travelers with essential information about common topics of conversation in Pune, such as places to visit and activities to do. We are developing a city guide app to offer comprehensive and current information not only to tourists, but also to local residents.
This app will provide details about tourist attractions, sightseeing locations, amusement parks and their operating hours, shopping areas, restaurants, and cafeterias in the city.
To provide detailed maps and directions to help users navigate the city.
To allow users to leave reviews and ratings for places they have visited to help other users make informed decisions.
To allow users to save their favorite places.
To allow users to share their experiences with friends and family through social media integration.
